# Twirly

A IR remote-controlled turntable. Useful for are moving stuff that you (can't/ are too lazy to) get to. It's also useful if you need a constant speed rotation (eg videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR0v6CCrpZc)). You can pick up relatively cheap ones (similar to the cost of this DIY version) that do the same thing, but building one is more interesting.
