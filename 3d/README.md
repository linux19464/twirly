# Gears and Case

These stl files were made with [openSCAD](https://openscad.org/) for the bearing drive. The script that generated the stl files is also here in case you need to tweak things due to using different parts. The gears script it was based on was written by @chrisspen (https://github.com/chrisspen/gears)

You can most likely ignore this, but it's being left here for anyone who has a motor that spins only in a horizontal plane. The worm gear gives a way to convert the rotation to the z axis.

For this configuration, the case comes in two parts to simplify assembly and give a little wiggle room for aligning gears. Glue the bearings to the sides (`sides.stl`) and then attach the motor (and worm gear - see photo) to the base (`base.stl`), and glue this to the sides.
