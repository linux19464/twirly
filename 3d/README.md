# Gears and Case

These stl files were made with [openSCAD](https://openscad.org/) for the bearing drive. The script that generated the stl files is also here in case you need to tweak things due to using different parts. The gears script it was based on was written by @chrisspen (https://github.com/chrisspen/gears)
