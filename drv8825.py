Rob Hamerling, Version 0.3 September 2023

This driver was developed after some examples:
    https://github.com/gavinlyonsrepo/RpiMotorLib
    https://github.com/redoxcode/micropython-stepper

    Hardware wiring considerations of Microcontroller and DRV8825 board:
    Mandatory connections, to be specified as pin numbers:
    - STEP:     Stepper motor movement.
    Optional connections:
    - DIR:      Direction pin.
                When motor is used in only one direction this
                pin could be pulled high or low externally.
                Direction commands will be ignored.
    - M0,M1,M2: When it must be possible to select different
                microsteps all three pins must be connected
                and specified as a tuple.
                When microstepping is not required these
                pins of the DRV8825 may be left unconnected,
                in which case stepping is per full steps.
                The pins may also be pulled-up or pulled-down
                by external resistors, in which case stepping
                is always a fixed number of microsteps.
    - SLEEP, RESET: Must be pulled high by external resistors
                or should be connected and specified.
    - TIMER     Timer for stepping rate.

    Note: ENABLE pin of DRV8825 may be left unconnected or must be
          pulled low externally for the DRV8825 to become operational.

    Three modes of operation are forseen:
        - performing a number of steps
        - performing a number of full rotations
        - stepping indefinitely (until stopped)
    In all cases stepping direction, frequency and micro-stepping can be selected
